1. 1st Solution -> g_diam.c -> implementation of Graph by Adjacency Matrix method -> Time Complex O(V * V)
2. 2nd Solution -> g_diam.1.c -> implementation of Graph by Adjacency list method -> optimized solution as Time Complex O(V + E)
3. DFT is used and DFS is used for each node + Backtracking 
4. at each point the max_length_path is consider.
